    "Road traffic crashes represent a mojor public safety and economic concern for urban areas. In the city of Chicago, traffic accidents results in injuries, fatalities, property damage, traffic congestion and increased costs for emergency response and healthcare services. Improving road safety requires not only accurate predictions but also a clear understanding of the various factors that contribute to severe crashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project uses historical traffic crash data from the City of Chicago to predict traffic crash severity by applying a combination of white box and black box machine learning models, such as logistic regression and decision trees, are used to provide transparent and easily interpreatble insights into crash risk factors. Black-box models, including ensemble and advanced machine learning techniques, are employed to achieve higher predictive accuracy by capturing complex patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "By comparing the performance and insights from both model types, the project ensures a balance between model accuracy and explainability. This dual-model approach allows stakeholders to trust the predictions while also understanding why certain crashes are more likely to result in severe outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this project demonstrates how combining interpretable and high-performance machine learning models can enhance decision-making, reduce crash severity, and improve urban road safety outcomes."
