    "Road traffic crashes remain a major public safety challenge, leading to injuries, loss of life, and substantial economic costs. While large volumes of traffic crash data are routinely collected, there is a need for analytical approaches that not only predict crash-related outcomes but also clearly explain the factors that contribute to accidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project develops a machine learning framework that uses both interpretable (white-box) models and more complex (black-box) models to predict the primary contributory cause of a traffic crash. The models leverage information about vehicles, people involved, roadway characteristics, traffic controls, and environmental conditions to identify patterns associated with different crash causes.\n",

High-performing black-box models can achieve strong predictive accuracy but often lack transparency, making their outputs difficult to trust or justify in policy and safety contexts. Conversely, fully interpretable models may sacrifice predictive performance.\n",

    "## Target Variable Engineering: Crash Cause\n",
    "\n",
    "The original `prim_contributory_cause` column contained many very specific crash causes. While this level of detail is useful, it created a large number of categories, which made the dataset highly imbalanced and difficult for our machine learning models to learn effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, we grouped the original crash causes into broader, more meaningful categories. This allowed us to reduce noise in the target variable, simplify the classification task, and improve interpretability of the model outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Crash Cause Grouping\n",
    "\n",
    "We grouped the crash causes into the following categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Driver Error**: Causes related to driver behavior or decision-making, such as failing to yield, following too closely, or disregarding traffic signals.\n",
    "- **Non-Driver Technical**: Causes related to external or technical factors, including weather conditions, road defects, or vehicle equipment issues.\n",
    "- **Other**: Causes that did not clearly fit into the main categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value **\"UNABLE TO DETERMINE\"** was treated as missing data because it does not provide meaningful information about the actual cause of a crash. We removed these rows to avoid introducing uncertainty into the modeling process.\n",
    "\n",
    "After creating the new `Crash_Cause` column, we dropped the original `prim_contributory_cause` column and used the engineered variable as the target for our classification models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Distribution After Grouping\n",
    "\n",
    "After grouping the crash causes, the class distribution became more balanced and manageable. This helped our models focus on learning meaningful patterns instead of being dominated by rare or overly specific categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "By reducing extreme class imbalance and simplifying the target variable, we also minimized the risk of unstable learning behavior in our pipelines, such as the model overfitting to very small classes. This resulted in a more reliable and interpretable modeling process."

    "Observation from your initial results: Your initial Decision Tree had high Accuracy (0.74) but a lower Macro F1 (0.44) compared to Logistic Regression. This indicates it was overfitting the majority class (Driver Error) and ignoring the minority classes (Non-Driver Technical).\n",

    "Parameter Tuned: max_depth (Tree Height)\n",

    "Depth 15: Complex rules (\"If raining, and dark, and Tuesday, and 55th street...\"). High accuracy, but likely memorizing specific events (Overfitting).\n",
    "\n",
    "Why we tuned it: We needed to find the \"sweet spot\" where the tree is deep enough to understand the difference between a \"Wet Road\" crash and a \"Speeding\" crash, but not so deep that it gets confused by randomness.\n",

    "Setting: 5 vs 20.\n",

    "Why: If we set this to 1, the tree might make a rule based on one weird accident. By setting it to 20, we force the tree to only make rules that apply to groups of accidents. This makes the model more reliable (Generalizable).\n"

    "Why we tuned it: We tested 100 vs 200. Usually, more trees are better because they smooth out errors. However, at a certain point, adding more trees just slows down the computer without adding accuracy. We tuned this to find the efficient limit.\n",

    "Why: In a Random Forest, we can often allow trees to grow deeper (e.g., None or 20) than a single Decision Tree. Because the forest averages the results, the risk of overfitting is lower. We tested if \"deeper trees\" gave the forest more power.\n",
