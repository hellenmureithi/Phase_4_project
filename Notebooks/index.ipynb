    "Road traffic crashes remain a major public safety challenge, leading to injuries, loss of life, and substantial economic costs. While large volumes of traffic crash data are routinely collected, there is a need for analytical approaches that not only predict crash-related outcomes but also clearly explain the factors that contribute to accidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project develops a machine learning framework that uses both interpretable (white-box) models and more complex (black-box) models to predict the primary contributory cause of a traffic crash. The models leverage information about vehicles, people involved, roadway characteristics, traffic controls, and environmental conditions to identify patterns associated with different crash causes.\n",

High-performing black-box models can achieve strong predictive accuracy but often lack transparency, making their outputs difficult to trust or justify in policy and safety contexts. Conversely, fully interpretable models may sacrifice predictive performance.\n",

    "\n",
    "The original `prim_contributory_cause` column contained many very specific crash causes. While this level of detail is useful, it created a large number of categories, which made the dataset highly imbalanced and difficult for our machine learning models to learn effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, we grouped the original crash causes into broader, more meaningful categories. This allowed us to reduce noise in the target variable, simplify the classification task, and improve interpretability of the model outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Crash Cause Grouping\n",
    "\n",
    "We grouped the crash causes into the following categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Driver Error**: Causes related to driver behavior or decision-making, such as failing to yield, following too closely, or disregarding traffic signals.\n",
    "- **Non-Driver Technical**: Causes related to external or technical factors, including weather conditions, road defects, or vehicle equipment issues.\n",
    "- **Other**: Causes that did not clearly fit into the main categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value **\"UNABLE TO DETERMINE\"** was treated as missing data because it does not provide meaningful information about the actual cause of a crash. We removed these rows to avoid introducing uncertainty into the modeling process.\n",
    "\n",
    "After creating the new `Crash_Cause` column, we dropped the original `prim_contributory_cause` column and used the engineered variable as the target for our classification models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Distribution After Grouping\n",
    "\n",
    "After grouping the crash causes, the class distribution became more balanced and manageable. This helped our models focus on learning meaningful patterns instead of being dominated by rare or overly specific categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "By reducing extreme class imbalance and simplifying the target variable, we also minimized the risk of unstable learning behavior in our pipelines, such as the model overfitting to very small classes. This resulted in a more reliable and interpretable modeling process."
