    "Road traffic crashes remain a major public safety challenge, leading to injuries, loss of life, and substantial economic costs. While large volumes of traffic crash data are routinely collected, there is a need for analytical approaches that not only predict crash-related outcomes but also clearly explain the factors that contribute to accidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project develops a machine learning framework that uses both interpretable (white-box) models and more complex (black-box) models to predict the primary contributory cause of a traffic crash. The models leverage information about vehicles, people involved, roadway characteristics, traffic controls, and environmental conditions to identify patterns associated with different crash causes.\n",
    "\n",
    "White-box models are used to provide transparent, rule-based insights that are easily understood by non-technical stakeholders, while black-box models are employed to capture more complex relationships within the data. By comparing these approaches, the project balances predictive performance with explainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting insights are intended to support vehicle safety boards, transportation agencies, and city authorities in identifying high-risk crash causes, prioritizing safety interventions, and designing evidence-based policies aimed at reducing preventable traffic accidents."

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "Transportation agencies and safety organizations often rely on descriptive statistics and manual reporting to understand the causes of traffic crashes. While useful, these approaches may fail to capture complex interactions among driver behavior, vehicle characteristics, roadway design, and environmental conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core problem addressed in this project is the lack of interpretable and accurate predictive tools for identifying the primary contributory cause of traffic crashes. High-performing black-box models can achieve strong predictive accuracy but often lack transparency, making their outputs difficult to trust or justify in policy and safety contexts. Conversely, fully interpretable models may sacrifice predictive performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project seeks to address this challenge by developing and evaluating both white-box and black-box machine learning models to predict crash contributory causes. By comparing model performance and interpretability, the project aims to identify an approach that provides reliable predictions while offering clear explanations that can be communicated to non-technical decision-makers. The ultimate goal is to support transparent, accountable, and data-driven traffic safety interventions."

    "By identifying the most likely cause of a crash, this project aims to help transportation authorities and safety organizations better understand underlying risk patterns and design targeted strategies to reduce traffic accidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specific Objectives\n",
    "1. Predict the Primary Contributory Cause of Crashes:\n",
    "Develop supervised machine learning models capable of classifying traffic crashes according to their primary contributory cause based on vehicle-level, person-level, roadway, and environmental features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Ensure Model Interpretability:\n",
    "Apply interpretable modeling techniques and explanation methods to make both global model behavior and individual crash predictions understandable, allowing stakeholders to see how specific factors influence predicted crash causes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Identify High-Impact Risk Factors:\n",
    "Determine the most influential factors associated with different contributory causes of crashes, including roadway conditions, environmental factors, vehicle characteristics, driver behavior, and temporal patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Compare Interpretability and Performance Trade-offs:\n",
    "Evaluate and compare interpretable (white-box) models with more complex (black-box) models to understand the trade-offs between predictive accuracy and explainability when predicting crash causes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Support Actionable Safety Interventions:\n",
    "Translate model insights into practical recommendations that can inform infrastructure improvements, targeted enforcement strategies, driver education programs, and policy decisions aimed at reducing preventable crash causes.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Promote Transparent and Accountable Decision-Making:\n",
    "Provide clear, defensible explanations that can be effectively communicated to non-technical stakeholders such as vehicle safety boards and city transportation authorities, supporting responsible and evidence-based traffic safety initiatives."

    "The dataset contains over 40 specific crash contributory causes, which can be highly granular and sparse for modeling. To simplify the analysis and improve interpretability, we grouped these causes into 5 broader categories or “buckets”:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Driver Error – Includes causes such as following too closely, failing to yield, improper turning, distracted driving, and other errors made by the driver.\n",
    "\n",
    " - External Factors – Includes causes outside the driver’s control, such as weather, road defects, visual obstructions, or animals.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Vehicle Defects – Covers mechanical issues such as brake failure or other equipment malfunctions.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Unknown – Cases where the contributory cause could not be determined or is not applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Other – Any remaining causes not captured in the above categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a mapping dictionary, each record in prim_contributory_cause was mapped to one of these 5 categories, with unmapped causes defaulting to “Other.”\n",
    "\n",
    "This step reduces noise, creates more balanced target classes, and improves the interpretability of the predictive model.\n",

    "After applying the mapping, we verified the distribution of crashes across the new categories to understand the relative prevalence of each broad cause.\n",
