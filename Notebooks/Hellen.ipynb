    "Road traffic crashes continue to pose a significant public safety and economic challenge, particularly when they result in serious injuries or fatalities. Transportation authorities and public safety agencies are responsible for making critical decisions about infrastructure investments, traffic enforcement, and emergency response planning, often under constrained budgets and limited resources. To be effective, these decisions must be supported by data-driven insights that are not only accurate but also transparent and explainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conventional traffic safety analyses typically focus on historical trends and aggregated statistics, which may fail to capture the complex interactions between roadway conditions, environmental factors, driver behavior, and temporal patterns that contribute to severe crash outcomes. While advanced machine learning models can improve predictive performance, their limited interpretability can reduce trust and limit their usefulness in policy and operational contexts where accountability and justification are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project addresses these challenges by applying interpretable machine learning models to traffic crash data in order to predict crash severity and explain the key factors associated with injury- and fatal-level crashes. By integrating both interpretable (white-box) models and high-performing (black-box) models enhanced with explainability techniques, the analysis identifies how factors such as speed limits, lighting conditions, roadway characteristics, hit-and-run involvement, and time of day influence crash severity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The insights produced by this project are intended to directly support decision-making related to roadway safety improvements, targeted enforcement strategies, and resource prioritization. By translating model outputs into clear, actionable explanations, this analysis enables stakeholders to move beyond reactive responses and toward proactive, evidence-based interventions aimed at reducing the frequency and severity of traffic-related injuries and fatalities."

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "Traffic safety stakeholders face ongoing challenges in reducing the severity of road traffic crashes while operating under limited resources and increasing system complexity. Although large volumes of traffic crash data are available, decision-makers often lack clear, explainable insights into the factors that most strongly contribute to injury- and fatal-level crashes. Existing analyses frequently focus on descriptive statistics or predictive accuracy alone, which limits their usefulness for guiding infrastructure investments, enforcement strategies, and policy interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core business problem addressed in this project is the absence of transparent, interpretable models that can both predict crash severity and clearly explain why certain crashes are more likely to result in severe outcomes. Without interpretable insights, stakeholders risk making decisions that are difficult to justify, inefficiently targeted, or misaligned with real-world risk factors. There is a need for a data-driven approach that balances predictive performance with explainability to support accountable and evidence-based traffic safety decisions."
